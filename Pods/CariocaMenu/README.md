## üì≤ Installation

### CocoaPods
CariocaMenu is now available on [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org).
Simply add the following to your project Podfile, and you'll be good to go.

```ruby
use_frameworks!

pod 'CariocaMenu', '~> 2.0.1'
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralised dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate CariocaMenu into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "arn00s/cariocamenu"
```

Run `carthage` to build the framework and drag the built `CariocaMenu.framework` into your Xcode project.

### Manually

If you prefer, you can integrate CariocaMenu into your project manually.

Just Drag&Drop all the files under `Sources/` into your project.

## üíª Usage

### Preparing your menu controller

To create and display your menu, you'll need to create a custom **CariocaController** (UITableViewController & CariocaDataSource)

This will define your menu settings & appearance. Check **DemoMenuContentController.swift** for code sample.

### Creating your menu

For the complete code, check **MainViewController.swift**.
```swift
if let controller = self.storyboard?.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "DemoMenu")
    as? CariocaController {
      addChildViewController(controller)
      carioca = CariocaMenu(controller: controller,
                            hostView: self.view,
                            edges: [.right, .left],
                            delegate: self,
                            indicator: CariocaCustomIndicatorView()
                            )
      carioca.addInHostView()
}
```

### Managing rotation

To be able to manage the rotation of the menu, you'll need to forward the rotation event to your menu instance.

```swift
override func viewWillTransition(to size: CGSize, with coordinator: UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinator) {
  coordinator.animateAlongsideTransition(in: self.view, animation: nil, completion: { [weak self] _ in
    self?.carioca?.hostViewDidRotate()
  })
}
```

### Creating your custom indicator

Here's the simplest custom indicator. Feel free to check the **CariocaIndicatorConfiguration** extension for more customisation possibilities.

```swift
class CariocaCustomIndicatorView: UIView, CariocaIndicatorConfiguration {
  ///This will use the basic shape, and change the color to black.
  var color: UIColor = UIColor.black
}
```

### Boomerang

A boomerang always comes back to it's original place.
By default, the boomerang is set to `none`. It means that the menu will stay where the user let it.

The other boomerang options are :

- `horizontal` : The indicator will return always on the original edge.
- `vertical` : The indicator will return always on the original Y position. It may switch from Edge.
- `originalPosition` : The indicator will always come back to it's original position

## üë®‚Äçüíª TODO

- Add a check for the edges at the initialisation. (Only .left & .right are allowed)
- Add UI Tests
- Add a `live tutorial` to indicate users how to get the most of this menu

## ü§î FAQ

### üòç Why should I use `CariocaMenu`?

You're starting a new iOS app, and you want to innovate on the user experience.

### üáßüá∑ Why the name `CariocaMenu`?

I didn't want to use the same naming convention that **EVERYONE** uses. I could have named it `ASSuperCoolMenu`, but it sucks.
A `Carioca` is someone who lives in Rio de Janeiro üáßüá∑. I lived there for two months, and this idea was born while I was there.
